  <p class="text-4">So, you have arrived at a documentation of ncrpsamp.xyz! Perhaps you have been looking at the Board Index or a screen telling you that you need to register before you can access the website.

Some website permit guests to read posts or even post messages, while other websites only allow registered members to see the posts. On some website, many of the most useful features will only become available to you when you become a registered member. Because website is such a flexible system, permissions will vary considerably between website.</p>
        <h5>The Home Page</h5>
<p>Here are four key areas that are normally available to you on the opening page of the forum:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>Website header</strong> - At the top of the website's opening page you will find the website header, which contains items such as the website title, banner and logo. It also has a section with information about you, links to unread messages, as well as the date. There is usually a quick search box located here.</li>
<li><strong>Main menu</strong> - This menu is situated just below the website header and it contains links to the main sections of the website. On the main menu guests will usually find a link to register, as well as the option to log in. The menu may also have links to search, personal messages, the calendar, profile and the memberlist, depending on permissions.</li>
<li><strong>Board index</strong> - This appears on the main page of the website. Categories are used to make it easier to find the boards that interest you. For information on how to keep up to date with new topics and posts, please see How to view unread posts and replies. Once a board has been entered it is possible to post a new topic.</li>
<li><strong>Info center</strong> - In the default layout, the Info Center is located below the Board Index. Depending on how it has been configured by an administrator it contains interesting information and statistics about activity on the website.</li>
</ul>
</section>
		
		
        
        <section id="idocs_website_register">
          <h2>Registration</h2>
<h4>When and How to Register</h4>
<p>Website may choose to restrict access to the full website or selected areas, allowing only registered members to view the content. A guest should register when they wish to participate in forum discussions, visit a forum frequently, and access members-only areas and benefits.

A guest is any person or web spider that is not logged into the website. Once a person registers they become a member, although they will still show up as a guest until they log in.

Members may have access to profile and notification options that are unavailable to guests, although these options may vary, depending on the permissions which have been set by the website administrator. Members can also be placed in membergroups, made moderators or administrators, given special permissions and access to members-only areas. Being able to send personal messages, receive forum emails, and post new polls and topics are some additional benefits that may be available to members of the website.

A guest may register at any time by simply selecting the register option from the main menu.</p>
<h4>The Registration Screen</h4>
<p>Website require a guest to accept a registration agreement before the registration process can begin. By checking the option I Agree, a guest consents to comply with the agreement throughout the duration of their membership. Website may also incorporate a minimum age into the agreement process.</p>
<p><a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/web-register.jpg"><img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/images/web-register.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Upon arrival at the registration screen, a guest is requested to enter a username and a valid email address. Failure to use a valid email address may hinder registration, depending on how a website is configured.

The option to choose an authentication method is only shown if OpenID is allowed by the administrator as a registration option. If OpenID is not allowed, then a password must be entered.

A form of visual verification may be present in order to confirm that a guest is actually a person and not a bot. This verification may be requested in two ways - CAPTCHA and custom questions. The CAPTCHA method displays an image containing a random collection of letters, which a guest must enter into a text field. The custom questions method displays one or more relatively simple questions, which a guest must answer correctly. A forum may be configured to use both methods at the same time.

Once a guest completes the registration form, there are three possibilities for what is displayed next based on how the website is configured.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>Login</strong> - If registration is immediate, the new member will be automatically logged in after completing the registration form.</li>
<li><strong>Activation</strong> - If a message about email activation is displayed, the new account must first be activated before login. An email with instructions how to proceed is sent to the new member's email address.</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong> - If a message about member approval is displayed, the new account must first be approved by an administrator before login. An email acknowledging the new member is sent to their email address. Another email may be sent later to inform them whether or not their application has been approved.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Activating a New Account</h4>
<p>If a website is configured to require email activation before login, an email will be sent to the email address provided at registration. The username and activation link are displayed in this e-mail. Selecting the activation link activates the member's account and prompts them to login. If a problem occurs with the activation link, the email also provides an activation code that can be used to complete the process. Note that a link to reset the password may be included in this e-mail, depending on the activation method enabled on the website.

If a member attempts to login before completing the activation process, an error will be displayed noting that their email address must be validated. A Need another activation email? link is also displayed in case the email has somehow been lost.</p>
         
        </section>
<section id="idocs_website_login">
          <h2>Login</h2>
<p>You must login after registration and after being logged out of a previous visit. You have the choice of the normal login screen, and the quick login options.</p>
         <h3>The Login Screen</h3>
<p><a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/web-login.jpg"><img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/images/web-login.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This is the screen you see when you use the "Login" option of the main menu. It is also the first thing you will see in any 'members only' website.</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>Username</strong> - The member's username.</p>
<li><strong>Password</strong> - The member's password.</p>
<li><strong>Minutes to stay logging in</strong> - The number of minutes the browser cookie will last before expiring.</p>
<li><strong>Always stay logging in</strong> - Prevents the browser cookie from expiring.
When using a shared computer, a member probably should not stay logged in for a long time or check the "Always stay logged in" option, unless they remember to log out when finished. Leaving an account logged in on a shared computer makes it vulnerable to use by someone other than the member.</p>
</ul>
<h5>The quick login</h5>
<p>Website is configured to allow login from any page. This is called Quick Login. In the default theme it is located in the top, left corner of each page. Other themes may place it in different locations. If Quick Login is disabled or cannot be seen, the login screen can still be accessed from the main menu.

The session length drop-down menu corresponds to the "Minutes to stay logged in" option from the main login screen. Similarly, selecting "Forever" in this drop-down menu is the same as checking the "Always stay logged in option" on the main login screen.</p>
<h5>Password Reminder</h5>
<p>If a password is forgotten or lost, it can be reset by selecting the Forgot your password? option from the login screen. The username or email address for the account is requested to begin the password reset process.

If a member has not set a secret question, an email containing a password reset link is automatically sent to the member's email address. Clicking on the link allows the member to choose a new password. If a secret question has been set, they will be given the option of receiving the email or answering their question. Members may create or change their secret question in Profile > Modify Account > Account Settings

After answering the secret question correctly, a member may choose a new password. The password takes effect and can be used to login immediately.</p>
<p><a class="popup-img" href="assets/images/web-forgetpass.jpg"><img class="img-fluid border" src="assets/images/web-forgetpass.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<h5>Logging out</h5>
<p>When you have finished browsing the forum, you may decide to logout by selecting the <strong>Logout</strong> option from the Main Menu.</p>
        </section>
<section id="idocs_website_board">
          <h2>Board index</h2>
         <p>The Board Index is the central part of the home page of the website. This is where you will find a listing of all the categories and boards that you are allowed access to. The exact appearance of the Board Index is affected by the options chosen by the administrator, as well as by the theme. When the default theme is used, the main features of the Board Index are as follows:</p>
<ol class="list-unstyled">
<li><strong>Navigation Tree</strong> - This is located just above the Board Index and it consists of a series of links which help facilitate browsing through the different boards and child boards. On the Board Index this navigation tree consists only of the website name and links right back to the top of the Board Index.</li>
<li><strong>Mark all messages as read</strong> - This button is located just below the list of categories in the Board Index. It enables registered members to mark all posts in the entire forum as read. This also clears the list of posts in the Unread Posts section of the Forum Header.</li>
<li><strong>Category Name Background</strong> - This is the colour highlights panels which contain the category names.
<ul>
<li><strong>Collapsible Categories</strong> - If a category is collapsible, clicking the category name collapses (hides) or expands (shows) all the boards that belong to this category.</li>
<li><strong>Unread Posts</strong> - These links are found to the right of the category names and they take you to a list of all the posts from all the boards in the given category which you have not yet read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Boards</strong> - Within each category, you will see one or more boards listed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Board Name</strong> - the board name links to the Message Index (a list of topics) for that board.</li>
<li><strong>Board Description</strong> - this is found directly under the board name and it describes the content of the board. This section may also include links to child boards and/or specify the board's moderator(s).</li>
<li><strong>New Posts / No New Posts</strong> - these are usually found to the left of the board names and they show registered members whether there have been any new posts in the boards since they last read them. Some boards have child boards within them and in this case the "new posts in child board" icon shows that there are new posts, but only in a child board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
